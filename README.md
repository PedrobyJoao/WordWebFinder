# Word Web Finder

Welcome to *Word Web Finder*!<br><br>
This a simple exercise that I did using *JAVA*. The program reads the html looking for specific words that was specified in the program.<br><br>
Since this is just an exercise, I choose three words ("senha", "black friday", "promoção"), <Br>
if the program finds one of those words it will print "suspicious". Otherwise, it will print "safe"
<br><Br>
How to execute:<Br>
  - Compile: "javac WordFinder.java"<Br>
  - Execute: "java WordFinder --URL--" --URL-- can be any url that you want, i.e.: "java WordFinder https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/"<Br>
